# 15-web-challenges
A responsive profile card component built with HTML5 and CSS3. Project 01 of my 15-Web-Challenges journey


 This project is a responsive Profile Card designed to practice semantic HTML and CSS fundamentals. Key features include perfect centering using Flexbox,
 absolute positioning for layout elements, and smooth hover effects. It serves as the first step in my roadmap to mastering frontend foundations.
